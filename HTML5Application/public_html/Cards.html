							The game is simple, both you and the computer will be dealt a hand of 5 cards.
							The value of the cards in each hand will be added up and the hand with the higher 
							value will be the winner.

					<div><h3>War</h3>
						<p>
							In war the deck is shuffled and split in 2 between the player and the computer.
							Both player and computer then put down the card on the top of their deck and which 
							ever player had the higher card value takes both cards and shuffles them back into 
							their hand. If the cards placed down have the same value both player place down one 
							face down card and then one more set of cards to compare and continue this until one 
							of the cards has a higher value then the other.
							<br>		
							<br>
							The game ends when someone has no more cards in their hand, and the winner will be the 
							player with all the deck in their hand.
