				<div><h3>War</h3>
					<p>
						In war the deck is shuffled and split in 2 between the player and the computer.
						Both player and computer then put down the card on the top of their deck and which 
						ever player had the higher card value takes both cards and shuffles them back into 
						their hand. If the cards placed down have the same value both player place down one 
						face down card and then one more set of cards to compare and continue this until one 
						of the cards has a higher value then the other.
						<br>		
						<br>
						The game ends when someone has no more cards in their hand, and the winner will be the 
						player with all the deck in their hand.
